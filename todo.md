- [ ] **Exercise Definitions**: Define the 4 core exercises (calf-raises, ankle-circles, hamstring-stretch, resistance-band)

### ✅ Import Dependencies
- [ ] Add `useEffect` import to existing React imports
- [ ] Verify React 18+ compatibility for all features

- [ ] **Recent Notes**: Include last 2 notes per exercise in report

---

## 🎨 **UI/UX & Styling**

### ✅ Visual Design
- [ ] **Gradient Background**: Purple/blue gradient (`linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`)

- [ ] **Interactive States**: Hover effects, focus states, disabled states

### ✅ User Experience
- [ ] **Loading States**: Show "Processing..." during form submission
- [ ] **Completion Celebration**: Special message when all exercises done
- [ ] **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear buttons and form flows
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Color changes for completed exercises

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### ✅ Component Structure
- [ ] **Main App Component**: PTExerciseTracker wrapper
- [ ] **AuthForm Component**: Separate authentication component
- [ ] **ExerciseCard Component**: Reusable exercise component
- [ ] **Utility Functions**: Grade calculation, report generation

### ✅ Data Management
- [ ] **State Structure**: Properly nested state objects
- [ ] **State Updates**: Immutable updates for all state changes
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Form validation and error handling
- [ ] **Mock Data**: Sample users and exercise data

### ✅ Event Handling
- [ ] **Form Submission**: Async form handling with try/catch
- [ ] **Exercise Completion**: Toggle completion status
- [ ] **Note Management**: Save, cancel, expand/collapse notes
